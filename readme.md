# Model for Quadrilateral mesh optimisation method based on swarm intelligence optimisation
bgpModel.md2 and nanpu.md2 are the original geological model file, bgpModel.geo and nanpu.geo are the data file for mesh after model processing, bgpModel.msh and nanpu.msh are the original file after model mesh, bgpModel-after optimization.msh and nanpu-after optimization.msh  is the optimized mesh model.
